(ns consult.core
  "A clojure wrapper for http://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http.html

  Individual methods are provided of the form (method base data)
  where base is the base url for the service - by default Consul
  uses: http://localhost:8500

  There is also the (api base) function that returns a map
  of the existing methods with the base partially applied.

  Current functions include:

    * kv                        ~ Get a key-value pair
    * kv-put!                   ~ Put a new value against a key
    * kv-delete!                ~ Delete a key
    * agent-checks              ~ List checks registered against an agent
    * agent-services            ~ List services registered against an agent
    * agent-members             ~ List members registered against an agent
    * agent-join!               ~ Make agent join a cluster
    * agent-force-leave!        ~ Make agent leave a cluster
    * agent-check-register!     ~ Add a registration check ??
    * agent-check-deregister!   ~ Add a deregistration check ??
    * agent-check-pass!         ~ Add a pass check ??
    * agent-check-warn!         ~ Add a warn check ??
    * agent-check-fail!         ~ Add a fail check ??
    * agent-service-register!   ~ Register a new service with an agent
    * agent-service-deregister! ~ Deregister a service with an agent
    * catalog-register!         ~ Low level service registration
    * catalog-deregister!       ~ Low level service un-registration
    * catalog-datacenters       ~ Low level data-center listing

    * catalog-node              ~ Low level individual node information
    * health-node               ~ Node health
    * health-checks             ~ Node health checks info
    * health-service            ~ Service health
    * health-state              ~ Overall health state ??
